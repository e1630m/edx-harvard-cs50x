sort1 uses: Bubble sort

How do you know?: It performs very fast on sortd list, but gets exponentially slower on other lists as the datasize grows.

sort2 uses: Merge sort

How do you know?: Doesn't seem to be getting exponentially slower when the size of data grows. Also, it's faster than sort3, as Merge sort should be.

sort3 uses: Selection sort

How do you know?: It doesn't any faster on the sorted list (eliminating Bubble sort), and it's slower than sort2, leaving Selection sort.
